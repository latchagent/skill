name: clawcard
description: Email, SMS, virtual cards, browser checkout, file storage, credential vault, and ~300 paid API capabilities for autonomous agents. Run clawcard agent commands to interact with your resources. Use the clawcard-browser MCP server for web navigation and checkout.
---

You have access to ClawCard via the `clawcard` CLI. All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output. Always pass `--json` when calling these commands.

## Quick Start

```
clawcard agent info --json                             # Your identity, email, phone, balance
clawcard agent pay <slug> '<json>' --json              # Pay for any capability
clawcard agent catalog --json                          # Browse all capabilities
clawcard agent catalog-search "flights" --json         # Search capabilities
clawcard agent files list --json                       # Your files
clawcard agent creds --json                            # Your credentials
```

**ALWAYS check existing resources before creating new ones.** List cards before every purchase. Reuse open `merchant_locked` cards for the same merchant.

## Important: Async Capabilities

Some capabilities (video generation, music generation, deep research, website crawling) take time to complete. They return a job/task ID instead of immediate results. You MUST poll the corresponding status slug to get results.

**Every poll costs money.** Wait 10-15 seconds between polls to avoid wasting balance.

Example flow for music generation:
```
# 1. Start generation ($0.11)
clawcard agent pay music-gen '{"prompt":"upbeat lo-fi beat","customMode":false,"instrumental":true,"model":"V4"}' --json
# → returns { data: { data: { taskId: "abc123" } } }

# 2. Wait 15 seconds, then poll ($0.01 per poll)
clawcard agent pay music-status '{"taskId":"abc123"}' --json
# → returns status: "PENDING" or "TEXT_SUCCESS" or "FIRST_SUCCESS" with audioUrl
```

Status slugs for async capabilities:
- `music-gen` → poll with `music-status`
- `lyrics-gen` → poll with `lyrics-status`
- `image-gen-gpt`, `image-gen-nano`, `video-gen-*` (StableStudio) → poll with `stablestudio-status`
- `stability-3d`, `stability-audio` → poll with `stability-status`
- `replicate-run` → poll with `replicate-status`
- `clado-deep-research` → poll with `clado-research-status`
- `allium-sql` → poll with `allium-sql-status`, then `allium-sql-results`
- `dune-sql` → poll with `dune-results`
- `tako-deep-search` → poll with `tako-deep-status`
- `crawl-site` → poll with `crawl-status`
- `deep-research` → poll with `parallel-task-status`

## Browser Checkout (MCP)

For purchasing things on websites (domains, subscriptions, SaaS signups), use the `clawcard-browser` MCP server. It launches a browser with the ClawCard Pay extension.

**Setup:** If the browser MCP tools aren't available, help the user configure it:

- **Claude Code:** `clawcard mcp` or `claude mcp add -e CLAWCARD_API_KEY=<key> clawcard-browser -- npx @clawcard/browser`
- **mcporter (OpenClaw, etc.):** Add to `~/.mcporter/mcporter.json`:
  ```json
  "clawcard-browser": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["@clawcard/browser"],
    "env": { "CLAWCARD_API_KEY": "<key>" }
  }
  ```
- **Cursor / VS Code:** Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` or MCP config with same shape as above

**Flow:**
1. Create a card: `clawcard agent cards create --amount <cents> --type merchant_locked --memo "description" --json`
2. Launch browser: `launch_browser` tool with the checkout URL
3. Navigate and fill non-payment fields using `snapshot`, `click`, `fill`
4. Fill payment: `fill_checkout` tool with your card ID + billing details
5. The extension fills card number, expiry, CVC directly — you never see the card number
6. Review the page and submit

**MCP Tools:**

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `launch_browser` | Open browser with ClawCard Pay extension |
| `navigate` | Go to a URL |
| `snapshot` | Get page accessibility tree with @e1 refs |
| `click` | Click element by ref |
| `fill` | Type into field by ref |
| `detect_checkout` | Check if page is a checkout (returns confidence + amount) |
| `fill_checkout` | Fill card + billing fields securely (card details never reach the LLM) |
| `screenshot` | Capture the page |
| `close_browser` | Close session |

**Security:** Card details (PAN, CVV) go directly from the server to the browser extension. The LLM never sees or handles card numbers. Only the last four digits are returned.

## Tips

- For API capabilities, use `clawcard agent pay` — it handles payment automatically from your balance.
- For purchasing on websites, use the `clawcard-browser` MCP tools with a virtual card.
- Default to `merchant_locked` cards. Only use `single_use` for one-time purchases.
- NEVER silently pay for a subscription. Always warn the user first.
- If you need a capability, search the catalog: `clawcard agent catalog-search "<what you need>" --json`
- To add balance: `clawcard billing topup`
